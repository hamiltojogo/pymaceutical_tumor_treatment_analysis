Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens

The goal of this study was to compare Capomulin to other drug regimens used to treat SCC tumor growth. 

The population of the study was closly split between male (50.7%) and female (49.3%) mice.  

Of the four drug treatments of interest Campulin and Ramicane performed the best.  

Mice treated with those drugs had an average final tummor volumne around 35mm3 compared to almost 
60mm3 for Ceftamin and Infubinol. 

Additional annalysis for Capomulin shows that over the study period tummor growth in a single mouse decreased 
about 20 mm3. 

For future study, I would look more closely at how Ramicane performs over time because mice treated with Ramicane on average had 
smaller tummors.  Compared to the other four drugs of interest Ramicane also had the smallest maximum and minimum tummor growth. 

This study also highlights that there this a strong positive correlation between weight and and tumor size.  

One thing to keep in mind while reviewing these results is Capomulin and Ramicane and almost 
30% more measurements taken than Ceftamin and Infubinol which may be skewing the results of the study.
